# 365 Account SKU ID Friendly Names
It's rather frustrating that Microsoft don't include friendly names in their 365 Powershell commands (such as [Get-MSOLAccountSku](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/msonline/get-msolaccountsku?view=azureadps-1.0)).  
  
You can use this list to do lookups in your code and ensure that your reports are looking smart for those reading them.  
  
:thumbsup: Will always keep up to date with the latest names  
:thumbsup: Will update any issues on the same week  
:thumbsup: Will not change the URL or file name, so you can download in your scripts if you wish  
  
  
:warning: Microsoft do not have any way to get a full and complete list of Account SKU friendly names, so there may be some missing from this list.  

## My tenant has a SKU that isn't on this list
If you find a SKU that isn't on here, please do let me know by logging an issue.  
After logging into the [Microsoft Admin Portal](https://admin.microsoft.com), you can get an XML list of names for your tenant here: https://admin.microsoft.com/admin/api/tenant/accountSkus
