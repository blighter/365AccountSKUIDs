# 365 Account SKU ID Friendly Names
It's rather frustrating that Microsoft don't include friendly names in their 365 Powershell commands (such as https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/msonline/get-msolaccountsku?view=azureadps-1.0).
You can use this list to do lookups in your code and ensure that your reports are looking smart for those reading them.

## My tenant has a SKU that isn't on this list
If you find a SKU that isn't on here, please do let me know by logging an issue.
After logging into https://admin.microsoft.com, you can get an XML list of names for your tenant here: https://admin.microsoft.com/admin/api/tenant/accountSkus
